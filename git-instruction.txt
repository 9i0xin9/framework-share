  Git download and install it from https://git-scm.com/
  a general CLI (Command Line Interface)

Understand Git

  [remote/origin] <> [local]
  git can import (pull) from remote to local or export (push) from local to remote
  git use three different storage spaces in each of case [remote or local]:

  | file sistem = local folder | index = space in local cache | repository = git local folder |
                              add <file>                    commit

0. Some CL to have in mind

   > ls -a                // show a list of files in the actual path
   > cd folder            // extend the path into a new folder
   > cd ..                // go a position back on the actual path
   > git branch           // show a list of branches of the local folder * is the active one
   > git checkout branch  // move into a branch

1.(first-time) Clone our Repository from remote to local (just first time)

   > git clone https://github.com/9i0xin9/framework-share    // move into the right path with cd LC
   > git checkout -b mybranch   // set a personal branch to work with

1. Update your local personal branch with all the udate of remote develop branch

   > git pull origin development:mybranch

2. Make your work all over your local folder

3. Add all files of your local folder into the index git space and commit it into your local git repository

   > git add *
   > git commit -m "helper to what you have work on"

4. Update again in case of new update from others devs

   > git pull origin development:development

5. Adjust if exist some merge conflict take care to delete the <<<<<HEAD line, ======, and the BRANCH line>>>>> just to keep the right codeline sequence.

6. Re add modified files and commit again it

   > git add *
   > git commit -m "helper to what you have work on"

7. Push all files on the remote develop branch

   > git push origin mybranch:development
